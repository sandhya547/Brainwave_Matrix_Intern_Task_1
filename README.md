The code implements a basic banking system where users can sign up and log in to perform operations like checking balance, depositing money, withdrawing money, and logging out. Here’s a step-by-step explanation of how it works:

User Data Storage:
-------------------
The program uses lists to store user information: usernames, emails, phone numbers, passwords, and account balances.

User Interaction Loop:
----------------------
The program runs a loop where users can choose to log in or sign up.

Login Process:
---------------
Users enter their username. If it exists, they provide a password.
If the password matches, they log in successfully and can access banking options.

Banking Options:
----------------
After logging in, users can:
Withdraw Money: Enter an amount to take out of their balance.
Deposit Money: Enter an amount to add to their balance.
Check Balance: View how much money they have.
Logout: Exit their account and return to the main menu.

Signup Process:
---------------
Users can register by entering their username, password, email, phone number, and initial deposit.
The program checks if the password and confirmation match and then adds the user details to the lists.

Error Handling:
---------------
The program shows error messages if users enter incorrect usernames, passwords, or if passwords don’t match during signup.

This banking system allows users to manage their accounts simply and effectively through a command-line interface.
